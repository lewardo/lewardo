I'm _lewardo_ (he/him), a hardware hacker, machine learning enthusiast, fs web developer, c++ aficionado, and parkour ninja in my spare time  
Currently working on _spectacle_, the open-source, accessible, augmented reality platform for everyone!

Motivated mostly by food and fixing a good 'ol segfault  
My poison of choice is C++ and C, with a soft spot for Julia for scripting, and either Vue3/Vite or plain 'ol JQuery for webdev

Proud to have been a part of the [FluCoMa](https://github.com/FluCoMa) project, and currently part of [Project Falcon](https://github.com/Project-Falcon)
