I'm lewardo (he/him), a hardware hacking nerd, machine learning enthusiast, web development hobbyist, C++ aficionado, and in my spare time a parkour ninja 

Currently working on _spectacle_, an open-source, accessible augmented reality platform!

Motivated by food mostly, or by squashing segfaults
My poisons of choice are C++ and C, with a soft spot for Julia and Python3 for scripting, and Vue3+Vite for webdev. Currently learning learning Rust.

Proud to have been a part of the [FluCoMa](https://github.com/FluCoMa) project, and currently a part of [Project Falcon](https://github.com/Project-Falcon), [Project Kestrel](https://github.com/Kestrel-Avionics), and Project SunStratos
